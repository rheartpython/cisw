Work with pre-made Azure Machine Learning experiments to better understand the data, modify and manage.

**_OPTION 1 - Online Fraud Detection Guided AML Experiments_**

* [Online fraud detection Azure Machine Learning Experiments - 5 Modules (START HERE)](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Online-Fraud-Detection-Step-1-of-5-Generate-tagged-data-2)


**_OPTION 2 - Choose your own adventure_**

Choose an experiment that interets you and explore the modules, trying your own data in the process.

* [Choose from the Cortana Intelligence Gallery experiments](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/browse?categories=[%221%22])

**_OPTION 3 - Operationalize the AML experiment as a web service_**

* Use [this](https://michhar.github.io/posts/a-python-flask-webapp-gets-smart) blog post as a guide to working with an n-gram featurizer and Kmeans clustering experiment, operationalizing it as a Python web service.

**_Final steps_**

For each of these open an intermediate dataset in a Jupyter notebook by adding an `Convert to CSV` module and right clicking the output node --> **Open in a new Notebook** and choose R or Python.  Then, perform some exploratory data analysis - summarize the data, plot to understand the spread (IQRs etc.), check the variables for appropriate types (categorical vs. continous), as examples.
